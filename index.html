        Those of us whose work is to write software are incredibly lucky. Building software is a guiltless pleasure because we get
        to use our creative energy to get things done. We have arranged our lives to have it both ways; we can enjoy the
        pure act of writing code in sure knowledge that the code we write has use. We produce things that matter. We are
        modern craftspeople, building structures that make up present-day reality, and no less than bricklayers or bridge
        builders, we take justifiable pride in our accomplishments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This all programmers share, from the most enthusiastic newbie to the apparently jaded elder, whether working at the lightest
        weight Internet startup or the most staid, long-entrenched enterprise. We want to do our best work. We want our work
        to have meaning. We want to have fun along the way.
